Although fundraising was the bulk of our business, we also had a website and sold direct to consumer through the site and at trade shows.  We sourced all of our own materials and mastered the art of crafting wonderful colors and smells.  Our work during this time centered around raising money for different groups as well as providing a living for our growing family.  This was a very demanding type of work requiring a lot of courage to cold call potential customers and even walk into their businesses unannounced to introduce myself.  I enjoyed every challenge and reward I experienced running the candle company."

That's why once I understood how to run my own business the obvious choice was to open a daycare.  I have successfully ran the home daycare for the past 10 years. Keeping the facility numbers under 12 at all times allows for daily interaction with all of the children between the ages of infancy to 6 years old. Supporting them along the way to a successful future, as well as, care for their physical and emotion needs. Daily communication with guardians regarding individual childâ€™s needs, skill sets, problems, and achievements. Develop and administer curriculum and activities. Encourage children to actively play and explore. Manage a small business, which includes finances, book/record keeping, child care regulations, interviewing, training, background checks, deadlines, goals, cooking, cleaning, etc."

I worked with kids ranging from new-born to 6 years old by myself out of the living room of my home.  WE continually worked to make the daycare into something more than watching kids out of our home.  We eventually built a daycare room and moved the kids and myself to the new area.  Working with kids this closely taught me a lot even though I was alread a mom to 3 children.  But like any small business owner I was ready to grow after 5 years in business.  In late 2012 I began working on a Large Family concept.  This would require hiring an employee and building additional daycare space.",

I had to manage my employee and work through all of the tax issues that come with an employee and more clients.  This required me to master time management and learn how to keep accurate books.  Our schedule has been the key to our success with the Large Family Facility.  We are on a very strict time frame and even the parents know proper times to drop off or pick up their children.  We enforce this to ensure all of the children in the facility are properly taught, rested, and fed.  A strict routine helps accomplish this.  The facility runs like a well oiled machine and new children adapt very quickly to the daily schedule.  I am looking forward to many more years in the child care field.",
